# Spotify for Facebook event suggestions
This is an application that shows a user suggestions of Facebook events based on their listening patterns on Spotify.

We take into account the artists in the a user's playlists to determine the facebook events that might be interesting. This is a trial version that would later include music genres, top  listened to artists/songs as filters.


The project uses:
- Pug as a views engine
- PostgreSQL as a database 
- Node.js for the back-end
- mostly custom made front-end
- SASS
- Spotify user authorization
- `npm` modules, such as spotify-web-api-node, facebook-events-by-location-core, sequelize, express, async
